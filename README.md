# Match Up

# Brief Description
A website created for University of Malaya (UM) students to create and join any activities inside the campus may it be studying together, playing sports, or others.
 
# Problem Statement
Through our survey, we found out that students around UM feel boring doing stuff by themself and wishes to know people with the same interests that would join their activities. Sometimes, when all our friend's are busy with things and we do not like doing things alone, it is very hard and awkward to approach strangers and invite them to join our activity. Moreover, we also cannot determined whether the person is interested in our activity.

# Solution
With Vue.js and Firebase, the website is created. Users are required to signup and login to create or join any activity. Every user can create activity by specifying the name, location, time and category of it. All activities with their details are shown in a table. All joined users will have their name shown in the table too. Every activity can be joined if the user is interested with it. Any activity that is already passed will be archived and not shown in the table.

# Future Features
1. Point system for every user where the activity creator can choose to exclude users with low points
2. Better user interface
3. Automatic filtering of unproductive activity
4. Others..
